**Zelig** is an interface, that allows a large body of different statistical models in the R statistical language to be implemented and interpreted in a common framework and interface.  The release of Zelig 5.0 expands the set of models available, while simplifying the model wrapping process, and solving architectural problems by completely rewriting into Râ€™s Reference Classes for a fully object-oriented architecture.
