# Zelig version 5.0-15

## Major changes

- Additional MC tests for Weibull, Gamma and Gammasurvey models.


## Bug fixes

- Fixed an issue with `model-survey` where `ids` was hard coded as `~1`. #144

# Zelig version 5.0-14

## Major changes

- `mode` has been deprecated. Please use `Mode`. #152

- The Zelig 4 `sim` wrapper now intellegently looks for fitted values from the
reference class object if not supplied via the \code{x} argument.

- New `to_zelig_mi` utility function for combining multiply imputed datasets for
passing to `zelig`. `mi` will also work to enable backwards compatability. #178

- Initial development on a new testing architecture and more tests for
`model-*`, Zelig 4 wrappers, `ci.plot`, and the Zelig workflow.

- `graph` method now accepts simulations from `setx` and `setrange`. For the
former it uses `qi.plot` and `ci.plot` for the latter.

- Improved error messages for Zelig 4 wrappers.

- Improved error messages if Zelig methods are supplied with too little
information.

- `model-arima` now fails if the dependent variable does not vary for one of the
cases.

## Minor changes

- Minor documentation improvements for Zelig 4 wrappers.

- Dynamically generated README.md.

- Removed plyr package dependency.

- `rbind_all` replaced by `bind_rows` as the former is deprecated by dplyr.

- Other internal code improvements
