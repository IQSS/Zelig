\title{Generalized Estimating Equation for Normal Regression}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{a symbolic representation of the model to be
estimated, in the form \code{y ~ x1 + x2}, where \code{y} is the
dependent variable and \code{x1} and \code{x2} are the explanatory
variables, and \code{y}, \code{x1}, and \code{x2} are contained in the
same dataset. (You may include more than two explanatory variables,
of course.) The \code{+} symbol means ``inclusion'' not
``addition.'' You may also include interaction terms and main
effects in the form \code{x1*x2} without computing them in prior
steps; \code{I(x1*x2)} to include only the interaction term and
exclude the main effects; and quadratic terms in the form
\code{I(x1^2)}.}

\item{model}{the name of a statistical model to estimate.
For a list of other supported models and their documentation see:
\url{http://docs.zeligproject.org/articles/}.}

\item{data}{the name of a data frame containing the variables
referenced in the formula or a list of multiply imputed data frames
each having the same variable names and row numbers (created by
\code{Amelia} or \code{\link{to_zelig_mi}}).}

\item{...}{additional arguments passed to \code{zelig},
relevant for the model to be estimated.}

\item{by}{a factor variable contained in \code{data}. If supplied,
\code{zelig} will subset
the data frame based on the levels in the \code{by} variable, and
estimate a model for each subset. This can save a considerable amount of
effort. You may also use \code{by} to run models using MatchIt
subclasses.}

\item{cite}{If is set to 'TRUE' (default), the model citation will be printed
to the console.}

\item{robust}{defaults to TRUE. If TRUE, consistent standard errors are estimated using a "sandwich"
estimator.}

\item{corstr}{defaults to "independence". It can take on the following arguments:}

\item{Independence}{(corstr = independence): cor(yit,yit')=0, for all t,t' with t not equal to t'.
It assumes that there is no correlation within the clusters and the model becomes equivalent
 to standard normal regression. The "working" correlation matrix is the identity matrix.}

\item{Fixed}{corstr = fixed): If selected, the user must define the "working" correlation
matrix with the R argument rather than estimating it from the model.}

\item{id:}{where id is a variable which identifies the clusters. The data should be sorted by
id and should be ordered within each cluster when appropriate}

\item{corstr:}{character string specifying the correlation structure: "independence",
"exchangeable", "ar1", "unstructured" and "userdefined"}

\item{geeglm:}{See geeglm in package geepack for other function arguments}

\item{Mv:}{defaults to 1. It specifies the number of periods of correlation and
only needs to be specified when \code{corstr} is stat_M_dep, non_stat_M_dep, or AR-M.}

\item{R:}{defaults to NULL. It specifies a user-defined correlation matrix rather than
estimating it from the data. The argument is used only when corstr is "fixed". The input is a TxT
matrix of correlations, where T is the size of the largest cluster.}
}
\value{
Depending on the class of model selected, \code{zelig} will return
  an object with elements including \code{coefficients}, \code{residuals},
  and \code{formula} which may be summarized using
  \code{summary(z.out)} or individually extracted using, for example,
  \code{coef(z.out)}. See
  \url{http://docs.zeligproject.org/articles/getters.html} for a list of
  functions to extract model components. You can also extract whole fitted
  model objects using \code{\link{from_zelig_model}}.
