\title{Exponential Regression for Duration Dependent Variables}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{a symbolic representation of the model to be
estimated, in the form \code{y ~ x1 + x2}, where \code{y} is the
dependent variable and \code{x1} and \code{x2} are the explanatory
variables, and \code{y}, \code{x1}, and \code{x2} are contained in the
same dataset. (You may include more than two explanatory variables,
of course.) The \code{+} symbol means ``inclusion'' not
``addition.'' You may also include interaction terms and main
effects in the form \code{x1*x2} without computing them in prior
steps; \code{I(x1*x2)} to include only the interaction term and
exclude the main effects; and quadratic terms in the form
\code{I(x1^2)}.}

\item{model}{the name of a statistical model to estimate.
For a list of supported models and their documentation see:
\url{http://docs.zeligproject.org/articles/}.}

\item{data}{the name of a data frame containing the variables
referenced in the formula or a list of multiply imputed data frames
each having the same variable names and row numbers (created by
\code{Amelia} or \code{\link{to_zelig_mi}}).}

\item{...}{additional arguments passed to \code{zelig},
relevant for the model to be estimated.}

\item{by}{a factor variable contained in \code{data}. If supplied,
\code{zelig} will subset
the data frame based on the levels in the \code{by} variable, and
estimate a model for each subset. This can save a considerable amount of
effort. For example, to run the same model on all fifty states, you could
use: \code{z.out <- zelig(y ~ x1 + x2, data = mydata, model = 'ls',
by = 'state')} You may also use \code{by} to run models using MatchIt
subclasses.}

\item{cite}{If is set to 'TRUE' (default), the model citation will be printed
to the console.}

\item{robust}{defaults to FALSE. If TRUE, zelig() computes robust standard errors based on sandwich estimators and the options selected in cluster.}

\item{if}{robust = TRUE, you may select a variable to define groups of correlated observations. Let x3 be a variable that consists of either discrete numeric values, character strings, or factors that define strata. Then
z.out <- zelig(y ~ x1 + x2, robust = TRUE, cluster = "x3",model = "exp", data = mydata)
means that the observations can be correlated within the strata defined by the variable x3, and that robust standard errors should be calculated according to those clusters. If robust = TRUE but cluster is not specified, zelig() assumes that each observation falls into its own cluster.}
}
\value{
Depending on the class of model selected, \code{zelig} will return
  an object with elements including \code{coefficients}, \code{residuals},
  and \code{formula} which may be summarized using
  \code{summary(z.out)} or individually extracted using, for example,
  \code{coef(z.out)}. See
  \url{http://docs.zeligproject.org/articles/getters.html} for a list of
  functions to extract model components. You can also extract whole fitted
  model objects using \code{\link{from_zelig_model}}.

\details{
Additional parameters avaialable to this model include:
\itemize{
  \item \code{weights}: vector of weight values or a name of a variable in the dataset
  by which to weight the model. For more information see:
  \url{http://docs.zeligproject.org/articles/weights.html}.
  \item \code{bootstrap}: logical or numeric. If \code{FALSE} don't use bootstraps to
  robustly estimate uncertainty around model parameters due to sampling error.
  If an integer is supplied, the number of boostraps to run.
  For more information see:
  \url{http://docs.zeligproject.org/articles/bootstraps.html}.
