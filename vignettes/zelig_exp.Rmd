Exponential Regression for Duration Dependent Variables with `exp`.

Use the exponential duration regression model if you have a dependent
variable representing a duration (time until an event). The model
assumes a constant hazard rate for all events. The dependent variable
may be censored (for observations have not yet been completed when data
were collected).

Syntax
------

```{r, eval = FALSE}
z.out <- zelig(Surv(Y, C) ~ X, model = "exp", weights = w, data = mydata)
x.out <- setx(z.out)
s.out <- sim(z.out, x = x.out)
```

Exponential models require that the dependent variable be in the form
`Surv(Y, C)`, where Y and C are vectors of length $n$. For each
observation $i$ in 1, ..., $n$, the value $y_i$ is the
duration (lifetime, for example), and the associated $c_i$ is a
binary variable such that $c_i = 1$ if the duration is not
censored (*e.g.*, the subject dies during the study) or $c_i = 0$
if the duration is censored (*e.g.*, the subject is still alive at the
end of the study and is know to live at least as long as $y_i$).
If $c_i$ is omitted, all Y are assumed to be completed; that is,
time defaults to 1 for all observations.

Input Values
------

In addition to the standard inputs, `zelig()` takes the following
additional options for exponential regression:

-  robust: defaults to FALSE. If TRUE, `zelig()` computes robust standard
   errors based on sandwich estimators and the options
   selected in cluster.

-  cluster: if robust = TRUE, you may select a variable to define groups
   of correlated observations. Let x3 be a variable that consists of
   either discrete numeric values, character strings, or factors that
   define strata. Then

```{r, eval = FALSE}
z.out <- zelig(y ~ x1 + x2, robust = TRUE, cluster = "x3",
               model = "exp", data = mydata)
```

means that the observations can be correlated within the strata
defined by the variable x3, and that robust standard errors should be
calculated according to those clusters. If robust = TRUE but cluster
is not specified, zelig() assumes that each observation falls into
its own cluster.

Example
------

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
rm(list=ls(pattern="\\.out"))
suppressWarnings(suppressMessages(library(Zelig)))
set.seed(1234)
```

Attach the sample data:

```{r, eval = TRUE}
data(coalition)
library(survival)
```

Estimate the model:

```{r, eval = TRUE}
z.out <- zelig(Surv(duration, ciep12) ~ fract + numst2, model = "exp",
               data = coalition)
```

View the regression output:

```{r, eval = TRUE}
summary(z.out)
```

Set the baseline values (with the ruling coalition in the minority) and
the alternative values (with the ruling coalition in the majority) for
X:

```{r, eval = TRUE}
x.low <- setx(z.out, numst2 = 0)
x.high <- setx(z.out, numst2 = 1)
```

Simulate expected values and first differences:

```{r, eval = TRUE}
s.out <- sim(z.out, x = x.low, x1 = x.high)
```

Summarize quantities of interest and produce some plots:

```{r, eval = TRUE}
summary(s.out)
```

```{r Zelig-exp, dev=c("png", "pdf"), eval = TRUE, fig.cap = "Graphs of Quantities of Interest for Zelig-exp"}
plot(s.out)
```

Model
------

Let $Y_i^*$ be the survival time for observation $i$. This
variable might be censored for some observations at a fixed time
$y_c$ such that the fully observed dependent variable,
$Y_i$, is defined as

$$
    Y_i = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
        Y_i^* & \textrm{if }Y_i^* \leq y_c \\
         y_c & \textrm{if }Y_i^* > y_c \\
       \end{array} \right.
$$

-  The *stochastic component* is described by the distribution of the
   partially observed variable $Y^*$. We assume $Y_i^*$
   follows the exponential distribution whose density function is given
   by

$$
    f(y_i^*\mid \lambda_i) = \frac{1}{\lambda_i} \exp\left(-\frac{y_i^*}{\lambda_i}\right)
$$

   for $y_i^*\ge 0$ and $\lambda_i>0$. The mean of this
   distribution is $\lambda_i$.

   In addition, survival models like the exponential have three
   additional properties. The hazard function $h(t)$ measures the
   probability of not surviving past time $t$ given survival up to
   $t$. In general, the hazard function is equal to
   $f(t)/S(t)$ where the survival function
   $S(t) = 1 - \int_{0}^t f(s) ds$ represents the fraction still
   surviving at time $t$. The cumulative hazard function
   $H(t)$ describes the probability of dying before time
   $t$. In general,
   $H(t)= \int_{0}^{t} h(s) ds = -\log S(t)$. In the case of the
   exponential model,


$$
    \begin{aligned}
        h(t) &=& \frac{1}{\lambda_i} \\
      S(t) &=& \exp\left( -\frac{t}{\lambda_i} \right) \\
      H(t) &=& \frac{t}{\lambda_i}\end{aligned}
$$

   For the exponential model, the hazard function $h(t)$ is
   constant over time. The Weibull model and lognormal models allow the
   hazard function to vary as a function of elapsed time (see and
   respectively).

-  The *systematic component* $\lambda_i$ is modeled as


$$
    \lambda_i = \exp(x_i \beta),
$$

   where $x_i$ is the vector of explanatory variables, and
   $\beta$ is the vector of coefficients.

Quantities of Interest
------

-  The expected values (qi$ev) for the exponential model are simulations
   of the expected duration given $x_i$ and draws of $\beta$
   from its posterior,


$$
    E(Y) = \lambda_i^{-1} = 1/\exp(x_i \beta).
$$

-  The predicted values (qi$pr) are draws from the exponential
   distribution with rate equal to the expected value.

-  The first difference (or difference in expected values, `qi$ev.diff`),
   is


$$
    \textrm{FD} \; = \; E(Y \mid x_1) - E(Y \mid x),
$$

   where $x$ and $x_1$ are different vectors of values for
   the explanatory variables.

-  In conditional prediction models, the average expected treatment
   effect (att.ev) for the treatment group is


$$
    \frac{1}{\sum_{i=1}^n t_i}\sum_{i:t_i=1}^n \left\{ Y_i(t_i=1) - E[Y_i(t_i=0)]
        \right\},
$$

   where $t_i$ is a binary explanatory variable defining the
   treatment ($t_i=1$) and control ($t_i=0$) groups. When
   $Y_i(t_i=1)$ is censored rather than observed, we replace it
   with a simulation from the model given available knowledge of the
   censoring process. Variation in the simulations is due to two
   factors: uncertainty in the imputation process for censored
   $y_i^*$ and uncertainty in simulating $E[Y_i(t_i=0)]$,
   the counterfactual expected value of $Y_i$ for observations in
   the treatment group, under the assumption that everything stays the
   same except that the treatment indicator is switched to
   $t_i=0$.

-  In conditional prediction models, the average predicted treatment
   effect (att.pr) for the treatment group is


$$
    \frac{1}{\sum_{i=1}^n t_i}\sum_{i:t_i=1}^n \left\{ Y_i(t_i=1) -
        \widehat{Y_i(t_i=0)} \right\},
$$

   where $t_i$ is a binary explanatory variable defining the
   treatment ($t_i=1$) and control ($t_i=0$) groups. When
   $Y_i(t_i=1)$ is censored rather than observed, we replace it
   with a simulation from the model given available knowledge of the
   censoring process. Variation in the simulations is due to two
   factors: uncertainty in the imputation process for censored
   $y_i^*$ and uncertainty in simulating
   $\widehat{Y_i(t_i=0)}$, the counterfactual predicted value of
   $Y_i$ for observations in the treatment group, under the
   assumption that everything stays the same except that the treatment
   indicator is switched to $t_i=0$.

Output Values
------

The Zelig object stores fields containing everything needed to
rerun the Zelig output, and all the results and simulations as they are generated.
In addition to the summary commands demonstrated above, some simply utility
functions (known as *getters*) provide easy access to the raw fields most
commonly of use for further investigation.

In the example above `z.out$get_coef()` returns the estimated coefficients, `z.out$get_vcov()` returns the estimated covariance matrix, and `z.out$get_predict()` provides predicted values for all observations in the dataset from the analysis.
