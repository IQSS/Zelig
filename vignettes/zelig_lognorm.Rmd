Log-Normal Regression for Duration Dependent Variables with `lognorm`

The log-normal model describes an event’s duration, the dependent
variable, as a function of a set of explanatory variables. The
log-normal model may take time censored dependent variables, and allows
the hazard rate to increase and decrease.

Syntax
------

```{r, eval = FALSE}
z.out <- zelig(Surv(Y, C) ~ X, model = "lognorm", weights = w, data = mydata)
x.out <- setx(z.out)
s.out <- sim(z.out, x = x.out)
```

Log-normal models require that the dependent variable be in the form
Surv(Y, C), where Y and C are vectors of length $n$. For each
observation $i$ in 1, …, $n$, the value $y_i$ is the
duration (lifetime, for example) of each subject, and the associated
$c_i$ is a binary variable such that $c_i = 1$ if the
duration is not censored (*e.g.*, the subject dies during the study) or
$c_i = 0$ if the duration is censored (*e.g.*, the subject is
still alive at the end of the study). If $c_i$ is omitted, all Y
are assumed to be completed; that is, time defaults to 1 for all
observations.

Input Values
------

In addition to the standard inputs, zelig() takes the following
additional options for lognormal regression:

-  robust: defaults to FALSE. If TRUE, zelig() computes robust standard
   errors based on sandwich estimators (see and ) based on the options
   in cluster.

-  cluster: if robust = TRUE, you may select a variable to define groups
   of correlated observations. Let x3 be a variable that consists of
   either discrete numeric values, character strings, or factors that
   define strata. Then

```{r, eval = FALSE}
z.out <- zelig(y ~ x1 + x2, robust = TRUE, cluster = "x3", model = "exp", data = mydata)
```

means that the observations can be correlated within the strata
defined by the variable x3, and that robust standard errors should be
calculated according to those clusters. If robust = TRUE but cluster
is not specified, zelig() assumes that each observation falls into
its own cluster.

Example
------

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
rm(list=ls(pattern="\\.out"))
suppressWarnings(suppressMessages(library(Zelig)))
set.seed(1234)
```

Attach the sample data:

```{r, eval = TRUE}
data(coalition)
```

Estimate the model:

```{r, eval = TRUE}
z.out <- zelig(Surv(duration, ciep12) ~ fract + numst2, model ="lognorm",  data = coalition)
```

View the regression output:

```{r, eval = TRUE}
summary(z.out)
```

Set the baseline values (with the ruling coalition in the minority) and
the alternative values (with the ruling coalition in the majority) for
X:

```{r, eval = TRUE}
x.low <- setx(z.out, numst2 = 0)
x.high <- setx(z.out, numst2= 1)
```

Simulate expected values (qi$ev) and first differences (qi$fd):

```{r, eval = TRUE}
s.out <- sim(z.out, x = x.low, x1 = x.high)
```

```{r, eval = TRUE}
summary(s.out)
```

```{r Zelig-lognorm, dev=c("png", "pdf"), eval = TRUE, fig.cap = "Graphs of Quantities of Interest for Zelig-lognorm"}
plot(s.out)
```

Model
------

Let $Y_i^*$ be the survival time for observation $i$ with
the density function $f(y)$ and the corresponding distribution
function $F(t)=\int_{0}^t f(y) dy$. This variable might be
censored for some observations at a fixed time $y_c$ such that the
fully observed dependent variable, $Y_i$, is defined as

$$
    Y_i = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
        Y_i^* & \textrm{if }Y_i^* \leq y_c \\
         y_c & \textrm{if }Y_i^* > y_c \\
       \end{array} \right.

-  The *stochastic component* is described by the distribution of the
   partially observed variable, $Y^*$. For the lognormal model,
   there are two equivalent representations:


$$
    \begin{aligned}
        Y_i^* \; \sim \; \textrm{LogNormal}(\mu_i, \sigma^2) & \textrm{ or
      } & \log(Y_i^*) \; \sim \; \textrm{Normal}(\mu_i, \sigma^2)\end{aligned}

   where the parameters $\mu_i$ and $\sigma^2$ are the mean
   and variance of the Normal distribution. (Note that the output from
   zelig() parameterizes scale\ $ = \sigma$.)

   In addition, survival models like the lognormal have three additional
   properties. The hazard function $h(t)$ measures the probability
   of not surviving past time $t$ given survival up to $t$.
   In general, the hazard function is equal to $f(t)/S(t)$ where
   the survival function $S(t) =1 - \int_{0}^t f(s) ds$ represents the fraction still surviving at
   time $t$. The cumulative hazard function $H(t)$ describes
   the probability of dying before time $t$. In general,
   $H(t)=
   \int_{0}^{t} h(s) ds = -\log S(t)$. In the case of the lognormal
   model,


$$
    \begin{aligned}
        h(t) &=& \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi} \, \sigma t \, S(t)}
      \exp\left\{-\frac{1}{2 \sigma^2} (\log \lambda t)^2\right\} \\
      S(t) &=& 1 - \Phi\left(\frac{1}{\sigma} \log \lambda t\right) \\
      H(t) &=& -\log \left\{ 1 - \Phi\left(\frac{1}{\sigma} \log \lambda t\right) \right\}\end{aligned}

   where $\Phi(\cdot)$ is the cumulative density function for the
   Normal distribution.

-  The *systematic component* is described as:


$$
    \mu_i = x_i \beta .
$$

Quantities of Interest
------

-  The expected values (qi$ev) for the lognormal model are simulations
   of the expected duration:


$$
    E(Y) =  \exp\left(\mu_i + \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2 \right),
$$

   given draws of $\beta$ and $\sigma$ from their sampling
   distributions.

-  The predicted value is a draw from the log-normal distribution given
   simulations of the parameters $(\lambda_i, \sigma)$.

-  The first difference (qi$fd) is


$$
    \textrm{FD} = E(Y \mid x_1) - E(Y \mid x).
$$

-  In conditional prediction models, the average expected treatment
   effect (att.ev) for the treatment group is


$$
    \frac{1}{\sum_{i=1}^n t_i}\sum_{i:t_i=1}^n \{ Y_i(t_i=1) - E[Y_i(t_i=0)] \},
$$

   where $t_i$ is a binary explanatory variable defining the
   treatment ($t_i=1$) and control ($t_i=0$) groups. When
   $Y_i(t_i=1)$ is censored rather than observed, we replace it
   with a simulation from the model given available knowledge of the
   censoring process. Variation in the simulations is due to two
   factors: uncertainty in the imputation process for censored
   $y_i^*$ and uncertainty in simulating $E[Y_i(t_i=0)]$,
   the counterfactual expected value of $Y_i$ for observations in
   the treatment group, under the assumption that everything stays the
   same except that the treatment indicator is switched to
   $t_i=0$.

-  In conditional prediction models, the average predicted treatment
   effect (att.pr) for the treatment group is


$$
    \frac{1}{\sum_{i=1}^n t_i} \sum_{i:t_i=1}^n \{  Y_i(t_i=1) -
        \widehat{Y_i(t_i=0)} \},
$$

   where $t_i$ is a binary explanatory variable defining the
   treatment ($t_i=1$) and control ($t_i=0$) groups. When
   $Y_i(t_i=1)$ is censored rather than observed, we replace it
   with a simulation from the model given available knowledge of the
   censoring process. Variation in the simulations are due to two
   factors: uncertainty in the imputation process for censored
   $y_i^*$ and uncertainty in simulating
   $\widehat{Y_i(t_i=0)}$, the counterfactual predicted value of
   $Y_i$ for observations in the treatment group, under the
   assumption that everything stays the same except that the treatment
   indicator is switched to $t_i=0$.

Output Values
------

The Zelig object stores fields containing everything needed to
rerun the Zelig output, and all the results and simulations as they are generated.
In addition to the summary commands demonstrated above, some simply utility
functions (known as *getters*) provide easy access to the raw fields most
commonly of use for further investigation.

In the example above `z.out$get_coef()` returns the estimated coefficients,
`z.out$get_vcov()` returns the estimated covariance matrix, and `z.out$get_predict()`
provides predicted values for all observations in the dataset from the analysis.
