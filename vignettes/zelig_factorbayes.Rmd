Bayesian Factor Analysis with `factor.bayes`.

Given some unobserved explanatory variables and observed dependent
variables, the Normal theory factor analysis model estimates the latent
factors. The model is implemented using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo
algorithm (Gibbs sampling with data augmentation). <!--For factor analysis
with ordinal dependent variables, see ordered factor analysis (), and
for a mix of types of dependent variables, see the mixed factor analysis
model ().-->

Syntax
------

```{r, eval = FALSE}
z.out <- zelig(cbind(Y1 ,Y2, Y3) ~ NULL, factors = 2,
               model = "factor.bayes", weights = w, data = mydata)
```

Inputs
------

zelig() takes the following functions for factor.bayes:

-  `Y1`, `Y2`, and `Y3`: variables of interest in factor analysis
   (manifest variables), assumed to be normally distributed. The model
   requires a minimum of three manifest variables.

-  `factors`: number of the factors to be fitted (defaults to 2).

Additional Inputs
------

In addition, zelig() accepts the following additional arguments for
model specification:

-  `lambda.constraints`: list containing the equality or inequality
   constraints on the factor loadings. Choose from one of the following
   forms:

   -  `varname = list()``: by default, no constraints are imposed.

   -  `varname = list(d, c)`: constrains the $d$\ th loading for
      the variable named `varname` to be equal to `c`.

   -  `varname = list(d, +)`: constrains the $d$\ th loading for
      the variable named `varname` to be positive;

   -  `varname = list(d, -)`: constrains the $d$\ th loading for
      the variable named `varname` to be negative.

-  `std.var`: defaults to FALSE (manifest variables are rescaled to
   zero mean, but retain observed variance). If `TRUE`, the manifest
   variables are rescaled to be mean zero and unit variance.

In addition, zelig() accepts the following additional inputs for
bayes.factor:

-  `burnin`: number of the initial MCMC iterations to be discarded
   (defaults to 1,000).

-  `mcmc`: number of the MCMC iterations after burnin (defaults to
   20,000).

-  `thin`: thinning interval for the Markov chain. Only every
   `thin`-th draw from the Markov chain is kept. The value of `mcmc`
   must be divisible by this value. The default value is 1.

-  `verbose`: defaults to FALSE. If `TRUE`, the progress of the
   sampler (every $10\%$) is printed to the screen.

-  `seed`: seed for the random number generator. The default is `NA`
   which corresponds to a random seed 12345.

-  `Lambda.start`: starting values of the factor loading matrix
   $\Lambda$, either a scalar (all unconstrained loadings are set
   to that value), or a matrix with compatible dimensions. The default
   is `NA`, where the start value are set to be 0 for unconstrained
   factor loadings, and 0.5 or $-$\ 0.5 for constrained factor
   loadings (depending on the nature of the constraints).

-  `Psi.start`: starting values for the uniquenesses, either a scalar
   (the starting values for all diagonal elements of $\Psi$ are
   set to be this value), or a vector with length equal to the number of
   manifest variables. In the latter case, the starting values of the
   diagonal elements of $\Psi$ take the values of `Psi.start`.
   The default value is `NA` where the starting values of the all the
   uniquenesses are set to be 0.5.

-  `store.lambda`: defaults to TRUE, which stores the posterior draws
   of the factor loadings.

-  `store.scores`: defaults to FALSE. If TRUE, stores the posterior
   draws of the factor scores. (Storing factor scores may take large
   amount of memory for a large number of draws or observations.)

The model also accepts the following additional arguments to specify
prior parameters:

-  `l0`: mean of the Normal prior for the factor loadings, either a
   scalar or a matrix with the same dimensions as $\Lambda$. If a
   scalar value, that value will be the prior mean for all the factor
   loadings. Defaults to 0.

-  `L0`: precision parameter of the Normal prior for the factor
   loadings, either a scalar or a matrix with the same dimensions as
   $\Lambda$. If `L0` takes a scalar value, then the precision
   matrix will be a diagonal matrix with the diagonal elements set to
   that value. The default value is 0, which leads to an improper prior.

-  `a0`: the shape parameter of the Inverse Gamma prior for the
   uniquenesses is `a0/2`. It can take a scalar value or a vector. The
   default value is 0.001.

-  `b0`: the scale parameter of the Inverse Gamma prior for the
   uniquenesses is `b0/2`. It can take a scalar value or a vector. The
   default value is 0.001.

Example
------

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
rm(list=ls(pattern="\\.out"))
suppressWarnings(suppressMessages(library(Zelig)))
set.seed(1234)
```

Attaching the sample dataset:

```{r, eval = TRUE}
data(swiss)
names(swiss) <- c("Fert", "Agr", "Exam", "Educ", "Cath", "InfMort")
```

Factor analysis:

```{r, eval = TRUE}
z.out <- zelig(~ Agr + Exam + Educ + Cath + InfMort,
               model = "factor.bayes", data = swiss,
               factors = 2, verbose = FALSE,
               a0 = 1, b0 = 0.15, burnin = 500, mcmc = 5000)
```

Checking for convergence before summarizing the estimates.  See the section [Diagnostics for Zelig Models](diagnostics.html) for examples of the output with interpretation:

```{r, eval = TRUE}
z.out$geweke.diag()
```

Since the algorithm did not converge, we now add some constraints on
$\Lambda$ to optimize the algorithm:

```{r, eval = TRUE}
z.out <- zelig(~ Agr + Exam + Educ + Cath + InfMort,
               model = "factor.bayes", data = swiss, factors = 2,
               lambda.constraints =
                   list(Exam = list(1,"+"),
                        Exam = list(2,"-"),
                        Educ = c(2, 0),
                        InfMort = c(1, 0)),
               verbose = FALSE, a0 = 1, b0 = 0.15,
               burnin = 500, mcmc = 5000)
z.out$geweke.diag()
z.out$heidel.diag()
z.out$raftery.diag()
summary(z.out)
```

Model
------

Suppose for observation $i$ we observe $K$ variables and
hypothesize that there are $d$ underlying factors such that:

$$
    \begin{aligned}
        Y_i = \Lambda \phi_i+\epsilon_i\end{aligned}
$$

where $Y_{i}$ is the vector of $K$ manifest variables for
observation $i$. $\Lambda$ is the $K \times d$ factor
loading matrix and $\phi_i$ is the $d$-vector of latent
factor scores. Both $\Lambda$ and $\phi$ need to be
estimated.

-  The *stochastic component* is given by:


$$
    \begin{aligned}
        \epsilon_{i}  \sim \textrm{Normal}(0, \Psi).\end{aligned}
$$

   where $\Psi$ is a diagonal, positive definite matrix. The
   diagonal elements of $\Psi$ are referred to as uniquenesses.

-  The *systematic component* is given by


$$
    \begin{aligned}
        \mu_i = E(Y_i) = \Lambda\phi_i\end{aligned}
$$

-  The independent conjugate *prior* for each $\Lambda_{ij}$ is
   given by


$$
    \begin{aligned}
        \Lambda_{ij} \sim \textrm{Normal}(l_{0_{ij}}, L_{0_{ij}}^{-1})
      \textrm{ for } i=1,\ldots, k; \quad j=1,\ldots, d. \end{aligned}

-  The independent conjugate *prior* for each $\Psi_{ii}$ is given
   by


$$
    \begin{aligned}
        \Psi_{ii} \sim \textrm{InverseGamma}(\frac{a_0}{2}, \frac{b_0}{2}), \textrm{ for }
      i = 1, \ldots, k.\end{aligned}

-  The *prior* for $\phi_i$ is


$$
    \begin{aligned}
        \phi_i &\sim& \textrm{Normal}(0, I_d), \textrm{ for } i = 1, \ldots, n.\end{aligned}
$$

   where $I_d$ is a $ d\times d $ identity matrix.

Output Values
------

The output of each `zelig()` call contains useful information which you
may view. For example, if you run:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
z.out <- zelig(cbind(Y1, Y2, Y3), model = "factor.bayes", data)
```

then you may examine the available information in `z.out` by using
`names(z.out)`, see the draws from the posterior distribution of the
`coefficients` by using `z.out$coefficients`, and view a default
summary of information through `summary(z.out)`. Other elements
available through the `$` operator are listed below.

-  From the `zelig()` output object `z.out`, you may extract:

   -  `coefficients`: draws from the posterior distributions of the
      estimated factor loadings and the uniquenesses. If
      `store.scores = TRUE`, the estimated factors scores are also
      contained in `coefficients`.

   -  `data`: the name of the input data frame.

   -  `seed`: the random seed used in the model.

-  Since there are no explanatory variables, the `sim()` procedure is
   not applicable for factor analysis models.
